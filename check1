Generate an SSH Key Pair
To access your Compute instances using SSH, generate an SSH key pair, associate the public key with your instances, and use the private key to log in to the instances using SSH.

Caution:Keep your SSH keys secure. Lay down policies to ensure that the keys aren’t lost or compromised when employees leave the organization or move to other departments. If you lose your private key, then you can’t access your instances. For business continuity, ensure that the SSH keys of at least two IT system administrators are added to your instances.
